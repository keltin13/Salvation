Salvation
 by Keltin Grimes

Salvation is a 3-dimensional first-person shooter where you battle through a
monster-filled maze to escape to salvation. Hellish creatures will continually
spawn as you blast your way to the exit with various hit-scan weapons, picking
up useful items and powerups on your way. Players can either play through the
campaign with pre-made levels, randomly generate a map, or even make their own
with the level editor. User map-creation is possible thanks to the
ray-casting technique, which renders a 2D map into a 3D perspective. While
in-game, press 'space' to open doors (if you have the special key!) and press
'b' to exit to the menu.

To play Salvation simply run the salvation.py file. The interface is relatively
intuitive and all three game modes can be accessed by clicking on their
corresponding buttons.

The following libraries must be installed:
    pygame (built on 1.9.6), math, string, random

There are no shortcut commands.
